**Course:** Deep Learning  
**Assignment:** Implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network with Backpropagation  

---  

## Overview
This repository has the **feedforward neural network** implemented from scratch along with the backpropagation algorithm. The network is tested and trained on the **Digits dataset** (used as a placeholder for Caltech-256 or MNIST). The implementation has support for multiple optimization methods, activation functions, and hyperparameter settings.

## Features
1. **Flexible Architecture**:
   - Easily modify the number of neurons in hidden layers.
   - Has support for **ReLU** and **Sigmoid** activation functions.

2. **Optimizers**:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Momentum-based Gradient Descent
- Adam Optimizer

3. **Loss Functions**:
   - Cross-Entropy Loss
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculates validation and test accuracy.
   - Plots a confusion matrix for the best model.
